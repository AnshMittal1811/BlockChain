# Image_Segmentation

This is a repository for understanding concepts of Image Segmentation by introduction to basics and building a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks. This was done with reference to the work that has been published on the webpage [Introduction to Image Segmentation Techniques in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/04/introduction-image-segmentation-techniques-python/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=computer-vision-implementing-mask-r-cnn-image-segmentation) and [How to perform Object Detection using Matterport's Mask R-CNN](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-in-photographs-with-mask-r-cnn-in-keras/), repectively.
